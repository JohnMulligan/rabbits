The swamp rabbit is the largest member of the cottontail genus. 
Although it is larger in overall size than other cottontails, 
it has smaller and rounder ears and coarser fur with a more yellow cast. 
Its thick fur is dense enough to waterproof its skin, and is usually a mix of dark brown, rusty brown, and black. 
Its throat and tail are white, and it has cinnamon-colored circles around its eyes. 
Swamp rabbits weigh between three and six pounds. 
Their total length varies from 16 to 22 inches, with males generally growing slightly larger than females.
